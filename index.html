                   Exploration is a big part of this game. 
                   You go around to the different regions unlocking the grace which is basically like a waypoint you can teleport to.
                   You go around defeating enemies that in turn give you currency that you can use to level up your character/worrier/mage. 
                   While you explore the map you'll come across dungeons where you'll be able to obtain treasures like armour or weapons or craftable parts/weapon upgrades. 
                   Some weapons can be found just by exploring. After you deem yourself worthy you'll go ahead and defeat one of main bosses and collect his rememberance to unlock endgame content. 
                   The thing with these type of games is you'll end up dying more times than you can count. Whcih is why upgrading your character wether weapons or level can be really useful.
